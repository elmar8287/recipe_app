# The `Recipe Application` on RoR

> The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.

### Build with:

- Ruby
- Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Front end stack

## Project milestones:

- Login page and registration page
